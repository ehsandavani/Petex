# Excel Visual Basic
Visual basic macros running Petex OpenServer commands in Excel

### Getting started

OpenServer macros running in Visual Basic are very often (or always) tied to an excel sheet where output and input are linked to specific cells. Hence the visual basic code is often not of value without the excel sheet. In this folder we can upload such excel sheets (with VBA code). The downside is that is it not possible to view the code directly, it needs to be opened from Excel.
